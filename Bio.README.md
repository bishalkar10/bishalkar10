# About   
Hello, I am Gain Prasad Kar. I am a self-taught software developer. I have a passion for web developement. I have build a few projects too.  
In the initial days I didn't have a laptop or pc. So, I learned python on a mobile. As I couldn't install frameworks to build better projects on a mobile, I have a good grasp on Python basics. On linkedin in the Python Developers Community I used to give corrent answers most of the time. I have build a few front end projects using Vanilla Javascript, Tailwind Css and React.js .  

I am a Bachelor's of Arts English Hons final year student. My 6th exam is starting from 26th June, 2023.  I am looking for a full time job as a frontend developer.
